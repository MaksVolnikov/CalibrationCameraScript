# CalibrationCameraScript
This module allows you to calibrate your mobile or stationary camera and calculate the errors of objects located in the photo.
In the source code, 3 options are used to estimate the errors of objects: an image on a flat object, an image of a more volumenous object than in 1 photo and an image of 2 objects in a profile photo.
To determine the objects in the image, the parametrs of the lengh, width and height of the image in three-dimensional space are used. After launch all images used in the calculation are dispalyed on the screen, and all calculated information about image area and errors is displayed in the console.
